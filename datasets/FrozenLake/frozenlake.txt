FrozenLake Benchmark Dataset

Overview:
    The FrozenLake benchmark dataset offers a robust platform for offline RL algorithm assessment within the FrozenLake environment from OpenAI Gym. Diverse dataset subsets represent varied agent behaviors across the slippery ice and holes.

Dataset Details:
    Source Environment: FrozenLake from OpenAI Gym
    State Space: Discrete (representing the agent's position on the grid, size varies with the grid dimension e.g., 4x4 or 8x8)
    Action Space: Discrete (4 actions: Left, Down, Right, Up)

Subsets:
    FrozenLake-Random
        Size: 1,500 trajectories
        Description: Demonstrates random exploratory actions, suitable as an elementary baseline.
    FrozenLake-Medium
        Size: 3,500 trajectories
        Description: Reflects semi-optimal decision-making, serving as an intermediate evaluation standard.
    FrozenLake-Expert
        Size: 5,000 trajectories
        Description: Embodies near-perfect navigation, setting a challenging performance pinnacle.
    FrozenLake-Mixed
        Size: 10,000 trajectories
        Description: Integrates behaviors, ranging from random navigation to adept traversals, offering a comprehensive testbed for algorithm versatility.

Applications:
    The FrozenLake benchmark dataset is primed to:
        -Benchmark offline RL algorithms against varied data qualities.
        -Establish performance metrics ranging from beginner to expert levels.
        -Examine algorithmic adaptability across mixed data scenarios.
    Usage:
        Format: Every trajectory in the dataset is a sequence of tuples, where each tuple encompasses: (state, action, reward, next_state, done).
        Dependencies: OpenAI Gym is a requisite to simulate or visualize the environment.
        Loading Data: Depending on the stored format, appropriate tools (like numpy or pickle) should be employed to load the dataset.
