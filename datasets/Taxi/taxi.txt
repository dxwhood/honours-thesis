Taxi Benchmark Dataset

Overview:
    The Taxi benchmark dataset is tailored for the evaluation of offline RL algorithms within the Taxi environment from OpenAI Gym. It encompasses different subsets, each indicative of distinct agent behaviors.

Dataset Details:
    Source Environment: Taxi from OpenAI Gym
    State Space: Discrete (500 states representing combinations of taxi, passenger, and destination positions)
    Action Space: Discrete (6 actions: North, South, East, West, Pickup, Dropoff)

Subsets:
    Taxi-Random:
        Size: 1,500 trajectories
        Description: Captures random exploratory actions, providing a foundational baseline.
    
    Taxi-Medium:
        Size: 3,500 trajectories
        Description: Illustrates semi-optimal behavior, useful for gauging algorithm capabilities.
    
    Taxi-Expert:
        Size: 5,000 trajectories
        Description: Depicts near-optimal actions, setting the performance gold standard.
    
    Taxi-Mixed:
        Size: 10,000 trajectories
        Description: Merges behaviors from random to expert, challenging algorithms to learn from diverse data.

Applications:
    The Taxi benchmark dataset is designed to:
        Benchmark offline RL algorithms against varied data qualities.
        Establish performance metrics ranging from beginner to expert levels.
        Examine algorithmic adaptability across mixed data scenarios.
    Usage:
        Format: Each trajectory in the dataset is a sequence of tuples, where each tuple contains: (state,      action, reward, next_state, done).
        Dependencies: Ensure you have OpenAI Gym installed to replicate or visualize the environment.
        Loading Data: Depending on the saved format, use appropriate libraries (like numpy or pickle) to load the dataset into your workspace.
